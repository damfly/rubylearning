my_string = 'Hello Ruby World'

def my_string
  'Hello World'
end

puts my_string
#=> For Ruby, there is an ambiguity here that it resolves by printing out the variable.
#The method could be called by resolving the ambiguity within the code, sepcifying we want to call the method itself

#Method call :
puts my_string() #=> Prints out Hello World, the use of brackets says specifically to Ruby that we want to use the method and not the variable
